# OMS
OMS (Opportunity Management System) provides a platform for students, faculty, and alumni of the Computer/Information Science department to post and view job internships, and research opportunities.

# Project Overview
OMS is designed as a web application allowing users to either view or post opportunities about job listings. Each opportunity will include the type of opportunity (Internship/Full-Time), a description of it, the name of the company it was posted by, and the title of the opportunity. There will be an option for former employees to review the opportunities, giving a comment and rating. If an opportunity peaks a user's interest, the company that listed it will have their contact information provided in a “Browse Companies” page. Companies will also be able to find users' information in the “Browse Users” page.
